\begin{chirpbox}
    \begin{problem}
        Given an array \( a \) and an integer \( x \), determine (if one
        exists) a pair of elements \( (a_i, a_j) \) such that \( \gcd{(a_i,
        a_j)} \) is strictly greater than \( x + \bigoplus_{k \ne i, j} a_k \),
        where \( \oplus \) denotes bitwise AND.
    \end{problem}
\end{chirpbox}

\begin{solution}
    We shall inspect the first obvious solution path, which is determining the
    maximum value of the gcd over all pairs. More specifically, we wish to know whether there exists an array such that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For any pair where the gcd is maximized, the bitwise AND of the remaining elements is not lesser and
        \item For some pair where the gcd is not maximized, the bitwise AND of the remaining elements is lesser
    .\end{itemize}
    We conjecture, however, that such an array does not exist.
\end{solution}
