\begin{chirpbox}
\begin{problem}
    Given an array of not necessarily positive integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \), choose values \( a_{n+1}, x \) such that for each \( i \), \( M - a_i \ge 0 \) and \( x \vert M - a_i \) such that
    \[
        \textsf{cost} := \sum_{i = 1}^{n+1} \frac{M - a_i}{x}
    \]
    is minimized, where \( M \) denotes the maximum of the array including \( a_{n+1} \).
\end{problem}
\end{chirpbox}

\begin{solution}
    Observe that we can first simplify the form of \( \textsf{cost} \):
    \begin{align*}
        \textsf{cost} &= \frac{1}{x} \sum_{i = 1}^{n + 1} M - a_i \\
        &= \frac{1}{x} \Bigl( (n+1) M - S \Bigr)
    ,\end{align*}
    where \( S \) is the sum of all the elements in the updated list. Observe that, if we were to know our maximum value, calculating the optimal value for \( x \) is easy:
    \[
        x = \gcd(M - a_1, M - a_2, \ldots, M - a_{n+1})
    .\]
    Thus, we must search for the best maximum value. There are two cases to oconsider:
    \begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt]
        \item The case where \( M = a_{n + 1} \), and
        \item The case where \( M \ne a_{n+1} \)
    .\end{enumerate}
    The latter case is far easier to handle since we don't have to choose the value of \( M \), as we can calculate \( \textsf{cost} \) directly after finding \( x \). The former case, on the other hand, is not so simple. This motivates the following claim:
    \begin{claim}
        The value of \( \textsf{cost} \) is optimal when \( M = \max\{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \} \). That is, \( M \) is strictly not equal to \( a_{n+1} \).
    \end{claim}
    The proof of this is omitted for time reasons, but it intuitively makes sense as increasing the maximum by \( x \) always increases the cost by \( n \); whereas, keeping the maximum constant and adding a smaller element only increases the cost by \( n \) in the worst case.

    With this, we can then simply choose \( a_{n+1} \) to be the greatest value of the form \( M - kx \) which isn't already contained in the array.
\end{solution}
